    """
    Calculate diastolic (dia) and dicrotic (dic) indices based on PPG signal, peak indices, and onset indices.

    if only the systolic peak is found; the key steps selected to find the dicrotic and diastolic peaks are:

    * Start from a second-order-derivative of The PPG signal; from the waveform arg_max to the waveform argmin
    * isolate peaks between positive and negative highs; dicrotic signal is found from the positive-highs
    * Find the index of the maximum peak in the dicrotic region and find the nearest diastolic peak
    * return a set of index:s for diastolic and dicrotic

    Process PPG data from raw signals, segmenting and detecting anomalies.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : np.ndarray
        Raw PPG signal.

    fs : float
        Sampling frequency.

    signal_integration_window : float, optional
        Integration window size (default is 0).
        If greater than 0, the function will perform area under the curve integration.

    segment : int, optional
        Number of segments to divide the signal into (default is 2).
        If set to 0, the function will process the entire array as a single segment.

    threshold : float, optional
        Threshold for anomaly detection (default is 2).
        Anomalies are detected based on the differences between consecutive peaks.
        Peaks with differences greater than this threshold are considered anomalies.

    return_as_segment : bool, optional
        If False (default), returns a single array with segments (or the complete signal)

        If True, returns individual segments along with any detected anomalies.

    Notes
    -----
    If segmentation is enabled (segment > 0), the function divides the signal into multiple
    segments and detects peaks within each segment. Anomalies are detected based on the
    differences between consecutive peak indices. Segments without anomalies are returned.

    If segmentation is disabled (segment = 0), the entire input signal is processed as a
    single segment.
